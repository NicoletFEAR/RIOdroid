Liscense Stuff
This code is heavily based on code provided by
Android Open Source Project (https://source.android.com/)

Thank you to everyone that worked on these projects and provided open source software for the community to use.

These files were released under various liscenses Apache, GPL2, etc.
I've included the liscense files everywhere, we think. If we missed something please let us know.

Any of the modifications and code that we wrote is fair game to be used by anyone.
